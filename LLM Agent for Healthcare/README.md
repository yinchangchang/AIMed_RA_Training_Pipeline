# LLM Agent for Healthcare - RA Training

This track focuses on LLM-based agents for healthcare tasks. The goal is to understand how to design, evaluate, and safely deploy LLM workflows in clinical contexts.

## Learning objectives
- Build basic LLM agent workflows with tools and memory.
- Learn prompt design and evaluation for healthcare tasks.
- Understand safety, privacy, and bias considerations.

## Training steps
1. OSC basics
   - Run a simple LLM experiment on OSC.
2. Agent prototyping
   - Implement a basic agent for a healthcare task (e.g., triage, QA).
   - Add evaluation with a small benchmark or curated set.
3. Paper reproduction
   - Reproduce a result from an LLM healthcare paper.
   - Summarize differences and possible reasons.

## Deliverables
- Agent code with clear prompts and evaluation script.
- Short evaluation report with metrics and error analysis.
- Notes on safety and compliance considerations.
