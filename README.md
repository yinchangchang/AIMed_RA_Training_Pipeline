# AIMed_RA_Training_Pipeline

This repo is a self-learning onboarding hub for students who are new to research but want to keep learning. The goal is to help them build fundamentals in AI for healthcare, demonstrate execution skills, and then join our research projects after passing a short training pipeline.

## AIMed Lab:
PIs and homepages:
- [Dr. Ping Zhang](https://www.pingzhang.net/)
- [Dr. Weidan Cao](https://caolab.org/)
- [Dr. Changchang Yin](https://yinchangchang.github.io/)

## How this training works
Students are expected to complete three steps quickly:
1. Learn to use OSC to run code.
2. Run basic tasks in AI for Healthcare, understand datasets and common clinical tasks.
3. Reproduce results from selected papers.


## Quick start (high level)
- Reach out to Dr. Yin (changchang.yin@osumc.edu) to get OSC access.
- Learn to run Python jobs in [OSC](https://www.osc.edu/resources/available_software/software_list/python).
- Get access to public datasets (EHR, imaging, and text).
- Finish the training of any direction below that you are interested in.
