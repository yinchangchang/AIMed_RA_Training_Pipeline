# Medical Image Modeling - RA Training

This track focuses on medical image analysis and model training workflows. The goal is to build practical skills in data preparation, model training, and evaluation for imaging tasks.

## Learning objectives
- Understand common medical imaging datasets and formats (DICOM, NIfTI).
- Run a baseline imaging model and interpret metrics.
- Learn preprocessing and augmentation pipelines.

## Training steps
1. OSC basics
   - Run a GPU-enabled job for a small experiment.
2. Imaging pipeline
   - Prepare a dataset split with a clear train/val/test protocol.
   - Implement a baseline model (e.g., 2D/3D CNN).
3. Paper reproduction
   - Reproduce a medical imaging paper result.
   - Compare your results to the reported metrics.

## Deliverables
- Dataset preparation notes and scripts.
- Training logs and evaluation metrics.
- Short report on reproduction quality and gaps.
